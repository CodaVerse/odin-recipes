                <li>6 large garlic cloves or 1 large tablespoon minced garlic</li>
                <li>1/2 yellow pepper, diced medium to small</li>
                <li>1-2 jalapenos or serranos to taste</li>
                <li>1/2 to 1 can white kidney beans for bulk</li>
                <li>1/2 head of cilantro</li>
                <li>1/2 medium red onion</li>
                <li>1 lime</li>
                <li>2 Roma tomatoes</li>
                <li>Sea salt</li>
                <li>Fresh ground black pepper</li>
                <li>Distilled white vinegar</li>
                <li>Optional: Tabasco (Chipotle or regular), cayenne pepper</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
        <div class='listdiv'>
            <ol class='vertical-ol'>
                <li>Remove peels and seeds from avocados. Consider leaving a half untouched until the end if you prefer it chunky. If so, complete all the mixing steps below, then add the last half diced to incorporate a chunky consistency.</li>
                <li>Add the avocados to a mixing bowl and mash to the desired consistency. A food processor can be used to make quick work of this.</li>
                <li>Add the garlic to the avocado paste</li>
                <li>Mix the avocado with the kidney beans to add some bulk</li>
                <li>Dice up the red onion, yellow pepper, jalapeno (or serrano) peppers</li>
                <li>Slowly add onions and peppers, ensuring not to overcrowd the mixture. It should be mostly avocado, but large additions can throw off the proportions. Be careful!</li>
                <li>Incorporate the half-head of cilantro</li>
                <li>Next, add a half teaspoon of sea salt and a half teaspoon of frsh ground black pepper</li>
                <li>Add roughly 1 teaspoon of distilled white vinegar to give the dish a small acidic bite</li>
                <li>Lastly, dice up the tomatoes and gently spatulate into the mixture. This is done last to keep the tomatoes from getting squishy.</li>
