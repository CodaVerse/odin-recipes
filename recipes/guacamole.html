        <h1>Guacamole</h1>

        <h2>Description of the dish:</h2>
        <p>Guacamole is an avocado-based dip, spread, or salad first developed in Mexico. It has become part of international and American cuisine as a dip, condiment and salad ingredient.</p>
        <p>In addition to being cold and refreshing, the guacamole recipe can often benefit form increasing the heat content, using additional jalapeno or serrano peppers. The recipe below can be scaled for a large yield with little extra effort, making this a great option for potlucks or to enjoy for a few extra days.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ripe Haas avocados (Haas is mandatory for taste - non-negotiable!)</li>
            <li>6 large garlic cloves or 1 large tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1/2 yellow pepper, diced medium to small</li>
            <li>1-2 jalapenos or serranos to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 to 1 can white kidney beans for bulk</li>
            <li>1/2 head of cilantro</li>
            <li>1/2 medium red onion</li>
            <li>1 lime</li>
            <li>2 Roma tomatoes</li>
            <li>Sea salt</li>
            <li>Fresh ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>Optional: Tabasco (Chipotle or regular), cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove peels and seeds from avocados. Consider leaving a half untouched until the end if you prefer it chunky. If so, complete all the mixing steps below, then add the last half diced to incorporate a chunky consistency.</li>
            <li>Add the avocados to a mixing bowl and mash to the desired consistency. A food processor can be used to make quick work of this.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic to the avocado paste</li>
            <li>Mix the avocado with the kidney beans to add some bulk</li>
            <li>Dice up the red onion, yellow pepper, jalapeno (or serrano) peppers</li>
            <li>Slowly add onions and peppers, ensuring not to overcrowd the mixture. It should be mostly avocado, but large additions can throw off the proportions. Be careful!</li>
            <li>Incorporate the half-head of cilantro</li>
            <li>Next, add a half teaspoon of sea salt and a half teaspoon of frsh ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Add roughly 1 teaspoon of distilled white vinegar to give the dish a small acidic bite</li>
            <li>Lastly, dice up the tomatoes and gently spatulate into the mixture. This is done last to keep the tomatoes from getting squishy.</li>
            <br>
            <em>Optional ingredients can be added to taste if there is more spice desired</em>
